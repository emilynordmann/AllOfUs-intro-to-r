# Introduction {-}

     alt="All of Us Logo" /></div>

This course is designed to be completed over approximately three weeks. For the first two weeks, there are several chapters of this workbook to work through asynchronously with an accompanying walkthrough video and suggested reading list. The time it takes to work through each chapter will vary considerably depending on your previous experience with R and programming. 

For complete novices, we estimate that each chapter will take between 1-2 hours and that you will likely want or need to watch the walkthrough video in full. Those with more experience with programming will likely take less time and for you we have included links to further resources so that you can go beyond the core material provided in this course.

In addition to the asynchronous content, there will be two live office hour sessions in Week 2 and 3. In these sessions, your instructors will answer questions about the content covered in this workbook and how to apply it to using the *All of Us* Researcher Workbench, as well as conducting quizzes to help consolidate your learning. Finally, to complete the course, there will be a 20-item multiple-choice quiz.
